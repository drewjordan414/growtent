Monitor your plant's health with live video analytics and various sensor readings such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light. This system combines a frontend built with React to display the data and a backend Flask server to handle sensor readings and video stream processing.

## Features

- **Live Video Stream**: View a live feed of your plants with real-time analytics overlaying the video.
- **Sensor Data**: Real-time readings from various sensors:
  - Temperature (in Fahrenheit)
  - Humidity (in percentage)
  - Soil Moisture
  - Light (in lux)
  
- **Predictive Analysis**: Utilizing TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub, the system can predict nutrient deficiencies from the live video feed.
  - This is still a work in progress
    
## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js and npm

## Getting Started

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
